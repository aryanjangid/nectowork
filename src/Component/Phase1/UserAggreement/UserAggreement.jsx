            <br /> CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOLUTION COMPANY AND
            BUSINESS PARTNER <br />
            <br />
            SERVICE CONTRACTS <br />
            <br />
            If an Solution Company and Business Partner decide to enter into a
            Service Contract, the Service Contract is a contractual relationship
            directly between the Solution Company and the Business Partner.
            Solution Company and Business Partner have complete discretion both
            with regard to whether to enter into a Service Contract with each
            other and with regard to the terms of any Service Contract. You
            acknowledge, agree, and understand that Nectowork is not a party to
            any Service Contract, that the formation of a Service Contract
            between Users will not, under any circumstance, create an employment
            or other service relationship between Nectowork and any User or a
            partnership or joint venture between Nectowork and any User.
            <br />
            <br /> With respect to any Service Contract, Solution Company and
            Business Partners may enter into any written agreements that they
            deem appropriate (e.g., confidentiality agreements, invention
            assignment agreements, assignment of rights, etc.) provided that any
            such agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand Nectowork’s
            rights and obligations under the Terms of Service, including this
            Agreement. <br />
            <br />
            DISPUTES AMONG USERS
            <br />
            <br /> For disputes arising between Solution Company and Business
            Partners, you may pursue your dispute independently, and you
            acknowledge and agree that Nectowork will not and is not obligated
            to provide any dispute assistance to you. If Business Partner or
            Solution Company intends to obtain an order from any arbitrator or
            any court that might direct Nectowork to take or refrain from taking
            any action, that party will (a) give us at least five Business Days’
            prior notice of the hearing; (b) include in any such order a
            provision that, as a precondition to obligation affecting Nectowork,
            we be paid in full for any amounts to which we would otherwise be
            entitled; and (c) include in any such order a provision that, as a
            precondition to any obligation affecting Nectowork, the party may be
            paid for the reasonable value of the services to be rendered
            pursuant to such order. <br />
            <br />
            CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION <br />
            <br />
            Users may agree to any terms they deem appropriate with respect to
            confidentiality. If and to the extent that the Users do not
            articulate any different agreement with regard to confidentiality,
            then they agree that this Section 4.3 would be applicable to them.
            To the extent a User provides Confidential Information to another
            User, the recipient will protect the secrecy of the discloser’s
            Confidential Information with the same degree of care as it uses to
            protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less
            than due care. On a User’s written request, the party that received
            Confidential Information will promptly destroy or return the
            disclosing party’s Confidential Information and any copies thereof
            contained in or on its premises, systems, or any other equipment
            otherwise under its control.

            <br /> WORKER CLASSIFICATION
            <br />
            <br /> Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or should be
            construed to create a partnership, joint venture,
            franchisor/franchisee or employer-employee relationship between
            Nectowork and a User. Solution Company is solely responsible for and
            has complete discretion with regard to selection of any Business
            Partner for any Requirement. Solution Company is solely responsible
            for and assumes all liability for determining whether or not a
            Business Partner should be engaged as an independent contractor and
            further warrants that: (1) its decision regarding engaging the
            Business Partner as an independent contractor is correct and; (2)
            that its manner of engaging the Business Partner as an independent
            contractor complies with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.

            NECTOWORK FEES
            <br />
            <br /> FEES FOR BUSINESS PARTNERS <br />
            <br />
            Business Partner shall pay Nectowork a Disbursement Fees for costs
            incurred in remitting payments to their bank account (“Disbursement
            Fee”) <br />
            <br />
            SOLUTION COMPANY FEES <br />
            <br />
            After an Admin has accepted a Requirement and has identified and
            assigned the same to a Business Partner, the Solution Company and
            the Business Partner will, after negotiations on Nectowork, enter
            into a Service Contract. Once the Service Contract has been executed
            by and between the Business Partner and the Solution Company, the
            Admin of the Solution Company agrees to upload the Service Contract
            on Nectowork within 2 Business Days from the date of its execution.
            Nectowork shall charge the Solution Company 12% of the total
            Business Partner Fees as has been agreed to by and between the
            Business Partner and the Solution Company in the Service Contract
            (“Service Fees”). <br />
            <br />
            The Solution Company agrees to disburse Service Fees to Nectowork
            within 15 Business Days from Nectowork having raised its invoice of
            Service Fees to the Solution Company. In case the Solution Company
            fails to pay Service Fees to Nectowork within 15 Business Days
            Nectowork holds the right to charge an additional 5% of Service Fees
            for the delay of every 15 Business Days thereafter. In case the
            Solution Company feels that there is a discrepancy in the invoice of
            Service Fees raised by Nectowork the Solution Company shall inform
            Nectowork of the same within 2 Business Days failing which the
            invoice of Service Fees will be deemed to be accepted by the
            Solution Company
            <br />
            <br /> GST AND OTHER TAXES
            <br />
            <br />
            Nectowork is required by applicable law to collect taxes or levies
            including, without limitation, income tax or GST (while some
            countries may refer to GST using other terms, e.g. VAT, we’ll just
            refer to VAT, GST and any local sales taxes collectively as “GST”)
            from the Solution Company (the “Taxes”). In such instances, any
            amounts Nectowork is required to collect for the payment of any such
            Taxes shall be collected in addition to the Service Fees owed to
            Nectowork under the Terms of Service. <br />
            <br />
            NO FEE FOR INTRODUCING OR FOR FINDING REQUIREMENTS
            <br />
            <br /> Nectowork does not introduce Solution Company to Business
            Partners and does not help Business Partners secure Requirements.
            Nectowork merely makes the Site and Site Services available to
            enable Business Partners to secure Requirements on their own and may
            from time to time highlight Requirements that may be of interest.
            Therefore, Nectowork does not charge a fee when a Business Partner
            finds a suitable Solution Company or finds a Requirement. In
            addition, Nectowork does not charge any fee or dues for posting
            public feedback and composite or compiled feedback, including
            Composite Information. <br />

            invoice of Business Partner Fees will be deemed to be accepted by
            the Solution Company. <br />

            Nectowork of the same within 2 Business Days failing which the
            invoice of Business Partner Fees will be deemed to be accepted by
            the Solution Company. <br />
            <br />
            REPLACEMENT
            <br />
            <br /> In the unlikely scenario that a Business Partner terminates
            the Service Contract entered into with an Solution Company on
            account of the Business Partner’s inability or non – availability to
            perform Business Partner Services, Nectowork shall replace such
            Business Partner for the Solution Company without charging any
            further additional Service Fees as follows: (a) in case the duration
            of the Requirement is less than 3 months Nectowork shall replace
            such Business Partner who within the first 15 Business Days from the
            execution of the Service Contract is unable or not available to
            perform Business Partner Services; (b) in case the duration of the
            Requirement is more than 3 months but less than 6 months Nectowork
            shall replace such Business Partner who within the first 25 Business
            Days from the execution of the Service Contract is unable or not
            available to perform Business Partner Services; (c) in case the

            (d) in case the duration of the Requirement is more than 9 months
            Nectowork shall replace such Business Partner who within the first
            60 Business Days from the execution of the Service Contract is
            unable or not available to perform Business Partner Services

            NON-CIRCUMVENTION <br />
            <br />
            MAKING PAYMENTS THROUGH NECTOWORK <br />
            <br />
            You acknowledge and agree that a substantial portion of the
            compensation Nectowork receives for making the Site available to you
            is collected through the Service Fee described in Section 6 and that
            in exchange a substantial value to you is the relationships you make
            with other Users when you identify or are identified by another
            person through the Site or Site Services (the “Nectowork
            Relationship”). Nectowork only receives the Service Fee when a
            Solution Company and a Business Partner pay and receive payment
            through the Site. Therefore, except as set out in Section 9.2, for
            36 months from the start of a Nectowork Relationship (the
            “Non-Circumvention Period”), you agree to use the Site as your
            exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for work
            directly or indirectly with that person or arising out of your
            relationship with that person and not to circumvent the Payment
            Methods offered on the Site. If you use the Site as an employee,
            agent, or representative of another business, then the
            Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents,
            or representatives of the business or its successor when acting in
            that capacity with respect to the other User. By way of illustration
            and not in limitation of the foregoing, you agree not to: Offer or
            solicit or accept any offer or solicitation from parties identified
            through the Site to contract, hire, invoice, pay, or receive payment
            in any manner other than through the Site. Invoice or report on the
            Site an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed,
            made, or received between Users. Refer a User you identified on the
            Site to a third-party who is not a User of the Site for purposes of
            making or receiving payments other than through the Site. You agree
            to notify Nectowork immediately if a person suggests to you making
            or receiving payments other than through the Site in violation of
            this Section 9 or if you receive unsolicited contact outside of the
            Site. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this
            non-circumvention agreement, please submit a confidential report to
            Nectowork at harshbbr@gmail.com. You acknowledge and agree that a
            violation of any provision in this Section 9.1 is a material breach
            of the Terms of Service. Your Account may be permanently suspended
            if you violate this Section 9.1. <br />
            <br />
            COMMUNICATING THROUGH THE SITE; NOT SHARING CONTACT DETAILS
            <br />
            <br /> For purposes of the Terms of Service “Means of Direct
            Contact” means any information that would allow another person to
            contact you directly, including, without limitation, phone number,
            email address, physical address, a link to a contact form or form
            requesting contact information, any link to an applicant management
            system or means to submit a proposal or application outside of the
            Site, or any information that would enable a user to contact you on
            social media or other website or platform or application that
            includes a communications tool, such as Skype, Zoom, Webex, or
            Facebook. For the avoidance of doubt, information is a Means of
            Direct Contact if it would enable another user to identify any of
            the information above through other sources, such as going to a
            website that included an email address or identifying you on social
            media, such as through Facebook or LinkedIn. Users agree to use the
            communication services available on the Site to communicate with
            other Users prior to entering into a Service Contract. You agree
            that prior to entering into a Service Contract, you (a) will use
            Nectowork as the sole manner to communicate with other Users; (b)
            will not provide your Means of Direct Contact to any other User or
            another person that you identified or were identified by through the
            Site; (c) will not use Means of Direct Contact of another user to
            attempt to or to communicate with, solicit, contact, or find the
            contact information of a User outside of Nectowork; (d) will not ask
            for, provide, or attempt to identify through public means the
            contact information of another User; and (e) you will not include
            any Means of Direct Contact or means by which your contact
            information could be discovered in any profile, proposal, job
            posting, invitation, or pre-hire communication through the Site’s
            communications services (including in each case in any attached
            file), except as otherwise provided on the Site. You acknowledge and
            agree that a violation of any provision of this Section 9.2 is a
            material breach of the Terms of Service. Your Account may be
            permanently suspended if you violate this Section 9.2. <br />
            <br />
            RECORDS OF COMPLIANCE
            <br />
            <br /> Users will each (a) create and maintain records to document
            satisfaction of their respective obligations under this Agreement,
            including, without limitation, their respective payment obligations
            and compliance with tax laws, and (b) provide copies of such records
            to Nectowork upon request. Nothing in this subsection requires or
            will be construed as requiring Nectowork to supervise or monitor a
            User’s compliance with this Agreement, the other Terms of Service,
            or a Service Contract. You are solely responsible for creation,
            storage, and backup of your business records. This Agreement and any
            registration for or subsequent use of the Site will not be construed
            as creating any responsibility on Nectowork’s part to store, backup,
            retain, or grant access to any information or data for any period.
            <br />
            <br />

            <br />
            In addition to the recognition that Nectowork is not a party to any

            Affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, agents,
            subsidiaries, joint ventures, employees and service providers from
            claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every

            <br />
            You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Nectowork, our

            using your username and password.
            <br />
            <br /> AGREEMENT TERM AND TERMINATION
            <br />
            <br />
            TERM AND TERMINATION <br />
            <br />
            These Terms of Service shall remain in full force and effect till
            the time you use the Site and Site Services. Unless both you and
            Nectowork expressly agree otherwise, in writing, either of us may
            terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion, at any time,
            without explanation, upon written to the other, which will result in
            the termination of the Terms of Service, except as otherwise
            provided herein. You may provide written notice to
            harshbbr@gmail.com. In the event you properly terminate this
            Agreement, your right to use the Site and Site Services is
            automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed. Nectowork is
            not a party to any Service Contract between Users. Consequently,
            User understands and acknowledges that termination of this Agreement
            (or attempt to terminate this Agreement) does not terminate or
            otherwise impact any Service Contract or Requirement entered into
            between Users. If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while
            having one or more open Requirements, you agree (a) you hereby
            instruct Nectowork to close any open Requirement; (b) you will
            continue to be bound by this Agreement and the Terms of Service
            until all such Requirements have been closed on the Site; (c)
            Nectowork will continue to perform those Site Services necessary to
            complete any open Requirement or related transaction between you and
            another User; and (d) you will continue to be obligated to pay any
            amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of
            the closure of any open Service Contracts, whichever is later, to
            Nectowork for any Site Services or such other amounts owed under the
            Terms of Service. Without limiting Nectowork’s other rights or
            remedies, we may, temporarily or indefinitely revoke or limit access
            to the Site or Site Services, deny your registration, or permanently
            revoke your access to the Site and refuse to provide any or all Site
            Services to you if: (i) you breach the letter or spirit of any terms
            and conditions of this Agreement or any other provisions of the
            Terms of Service; (ii) we suspect or become aware that you have
            provided false or misleading information to us; (iii) we believe, in
            our sole discretion, that your actions may cause legal liability for
            you, our Users, or Nectowork or our Affiliates; may be contrary to
            the interests of the Site or the User community; or may involve
            illicit or illegal activity; or (iv) we are required to by law,
            legal process, or law enforcement. If your Account is temporarily or
            permanently closed, you may not use the Site under the same Account
            or a different Account or re-register under a new Account without
            Nectowork’s prior written consent. <br />
            <br />
            You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill
            of the Site depend on transparency of User’s Account status to all
            Users, including both yourself and other Users who have entered into
            Service Contracts with you. You therefore agree as follows: IF
            NECTOWORK DECIDES TO TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT,
            NECTOWORK HAS THE RIGHT WHERE ALLOWED BY LAW BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION
            TO: (A) NOTIFY OTHER USERSTHAT HAVE ENTERED INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS
            WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS, (B) PROVIDE
            THOSE USERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR ACCOUNT CLOSURE.
            YOU AGREE THAT NECTOWORK WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR
            RELATING TO ANY NOTICE THAT IT MAY PROVIDE TO ANY USER REGARDING
            CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS OR THE REASON(S) FOR THE CLOSURE. <br />
            <br />
            ACCOUNT DATA ON CLOSURE <br />
            <br />
            Except as otherwise required by law, if your Account is closed for
            any reason, you will no longer have access to data, messages, files,
            or other material you keep on the Site and any closure of your
            Account may involve deletion of any content stored in your Account
            for which Nectowork will have no liability whatsoever. Nectowork, in
            its sole discretion and as permitted or required by law, may retain
            some or all of your Account information.
            <br />
            <br /> SURVIVAL
            <br />
            <br /> After this Agreement terminates, the terms of this Agreement
            and the other Terms of Service that expressly or by their nature
            contemplate performance after this Agreement terminates or expires
            will survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the
            provisions permitting audits, protecting intellectual property,
            indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth
            limitations of liability, by their nature, contemplate performance
            or observance after this Agreement terminates. Without limiting any
            other provisions of the Terms of Service, the termination of this
            Agreement for any reason will not release you or Nectowork from any
            obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that
            thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to
            such termination.

            <br /> DISPUTE PROCESS, ARBITRATION, AND SCOPE <br />
            <br />
            If a dispute arises between you and Nectowork or our Affiliates, our
            goal is to resolve the dispute quickly and cost-effectively.
            Accordingly you, Nectowork, and our Affiliates agree to resolve any
            claim, dispute, or controversy that arises out of or relates to this
            Agreement, any other Terms of Service, your relationship with
            Nectowork, the termination of your relationship with Nectowork, or
            the Site Services (each, a “Claim”) in accordance with this Section
            16 (sometimes referred to as the “Arbitration Provision”). Claims
            covered by this Arbitration Provision include, but are not limited
            to, all claims, disputes, or controversies arising out of or
            relating to this Agreement, the Site, Site Services, the Terms of
            Service, any Service Contract, any payments or monies you claim are
            due to you from Nectowork or our Affiliates or successors, privacy
            and all other legal claims arising out of or relating to your
            relationship with Nectowork or the termination of that relationship.

            CHOICE OF LAW <br />
            <br />
            The Site Terms of Use, the other Terms of Service, and any Claim

            INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION <br />
            <br />
            Before serving a demand for arbitration of a Claim, you and
            Nectowork agree to first notify each other of the Claim. You agree
            to notify Nectowork of the Claim at harshbbr@gmail.com, and
            Nectowork agrees to provide to you a notice at your email address on
            file (in each case, a “Notice”). You and Nectowork then will seek
            informal voluntary resolution of the Claim. Any Notice must include
            pertinent account information, a brief description of the Claim, and
            contact information, so that you or Nectowork, as applicable, may
            evaluate the Claim and attempt to informally resolve the Claim. Both
            you and Nectowork will have 60 days from the date of the receipt of
            the Notice to informally resolve the other party’s Claim, which, if
            successful, will avoid the need for further action.

            <br /> In the unlikely event that you and Nectowork are unable to
            resolve a Claim within 60 days, such Claim shall be referred to and
            finally be resolved by arbitration administered by the Delhi
            International Arbitration Centre (“DIAC”) in accordance with its
            rules for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be
            incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat and venue of the
            arbitration shall be New Delhi. The Arbitral Tribunal shall consist
            of a single arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be
            English, and all documents submitted to the arbitration shall be in
            their original form together with any English translations. You and
            Nectowork agree that any arbitration award shall be final and biding
            upon you and Nectowork and that obligations under this Agreement
            shall be carried on even in the event a dispute is referred to
            Arbitration. Nectowork shall not be liable towards you for any
            consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages.

            INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION <br />
            <br />
            This Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement
            relating to the formal resolution of Claims. Except as otherwise
            provided in this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision
            covers, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
            decide, all disputes arising out of or relating to the
            interpretation, enforcement, or application of this Arbitration
            Provision. In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is
            deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision
            will be enforceable. <br />
            <br />
            GENERAL
            <br />
            <br /> ENTIRE AGREEMENT <br />
            <br />
            This Agreement, together with the other Terms of Service, sets forth
            the entire agreement and understanding between you and Nectowork
            relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and cancels and
            supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements,
            representations, warranties, and other communications between you
            and us, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the
            subject matter hereof and thereof. The Section headings in the Terms
            of Service are included for ease of reference only and have no
            binding effect. Even though Nectowork drafted the Terms of Service,
            you represent that you had ample time to review and decide whether
            to agree to the Terms of Service. If an ambiguity or question of
            intent or interpretation of the Terms of Service arises, no
            presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring
            you or Nectowork because of the authorship of any provision of the
            Terms of Service
            <br />
            <br /> MODIFICATIONS; WAIVER
            <br />
            <br /> No modification or amendment to the Terms of Service will be
            binding upon Nectowork unless they are agreed in a written
            instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of Nectowork
            or posted on the Site by Nectowork. Email will not constitute a
            written instrument as contemplated by this Section 17.2. Our failure
            to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our
            right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We do
            not guarantee we will take action against all breaches of this User
            Agreement. <br />
            <br />
            ASSIGNABILITY
            <br />
            <br /> User may not assign the Terms of Service, or any of its
            rights or obligations hereunder, without Nectowork’s prior written
            consent in the form of a written instrument signed by a duly
            authorized representative of Nectowork. Nectowork may freely assign
            this Agreement and the other Terms of Service without User’s
            consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this
            subsection will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing
            restrictions, the Terms of Service are binding upon and will inure
            to the benefit of the successors, heirs, and permitted assigns of
            the parties. <br />
            <br />
            SEVERABILITY <br />
            <br />
            If and to the extent any provision of this Agreement or the other
            Terms of Service is held illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in whole
            or in part under applicable law, such provision or such portion
            thereof will be ineffective as to the jurisdiction in which it is
            illegal, invalid, or unenforceable to the extent of its illegality,
            invalidity, or unenforceability and will be deemed modified to the
            extent necessary to conform to applicable law so as to give the
            maximum effect to the intent of the parties. The illegality,
            invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that
            jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or
            enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any
            other provision in any jurisdiction. <br />
            <br />
